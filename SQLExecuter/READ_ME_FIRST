Note: 

The SQL.g file as distributed in A4.1 will NOT work correctly with a few of these
queries.  Specifically, it will not parse string literals with a "-" character in
it.  This is a bad thing, because all of the various "date" strings have this char
in them.  To fix this, just go into SQL.g and change the rule for CharString to:

CharString
        :       '"' (('a'..'z') | '-' | ('A'..'Z') | ' ' | ('0'..'9'))* '"'
        ;

Then recompile, and you should now be able to handle the "-" character in a string
literal with no problem.
